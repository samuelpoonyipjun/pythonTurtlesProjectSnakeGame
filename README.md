# pythonTurtlesProject
This is an example of a python project I created about the software turtles. Turtles is a software used to create designs using python. Simple animated games can be written using the software. 
The game created is like a simulation of the snake game written on turtles.

The black object represents the snake and the blue circle represents the food.

The snake is supposed to collect the food to earn points. 

When it hits the edge, the game ends as the player "dies".

As the snake eats food, it grows longer and the score increases by 1 each time. 

This code makes use of object oriented programming whereby classes were created for each object to define their positions, how they move and their design.
