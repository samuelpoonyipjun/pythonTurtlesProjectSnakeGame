# pythonTurtlesProject
This is an example of a python project I created about the software turtles. Turtles is a software used to create designs using python. Simple animated games can be written using the software. 
The game created is like a simulation of the snake game written on turtles.

The black object represents the snake and the blue circle represents the food.
The snake is supposed to collect the food to earn points. 
When it hits the edge, the game ends as the player "dies".
